# SortingTelegram
Multiple sorting implementations that sort and return the time taken on Telegram!

This project, initially attempted to create an interface for multiple sorting methods in Telegram. However, it was not accepted by our Professor Dr. Davtalab for not accurately representing the specifications.

Now this project has a TelegramBot interface that is activated via CLI options.

In order to use this as a TelegramBot, please make sure to include the API Bot Key obtainable from @BotFather.

Thank you for reading this far into the README.

Have a great day :)
